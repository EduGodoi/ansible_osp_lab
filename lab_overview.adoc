= Overview of the Lab

== Abstract

_As OpenStack popularity and complexity continue to rise and new feature sets 
are introduced regularly, findings ways to simplify and produce consistent 
results is always at the forefront of any system administratorâ€™s mind. With the 
use of Ansible, an agentless IT automation technology, a system administrator 
can do just that.

The goal of this lab is to provide a brief introduction to Ansible, the 
usability of Ansible playbooks, and then show how to leverage key Ansible 
modules to better manage and simplify OpenStack environments. These management 
playbooks will consist of typical administrative tasks such as:

* Managing Networks
* Managing Instances
* Managing Resources

This lab is best suited for system and OpenStack administrators looking for 
ways to automate their day-to-day OpenStack administrative tasks._


== Environment Overview

This lab will provide a step-by-step on using several http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_cloud_modules.html#openstack[Ansible OpenStack modules] 
to manage everyday tasks. 
The lab environment consists of a virtual machine running on 
https://www.ovh.com/world/public-cloud/instances/[OVH public cloud
instances] and the use of either the student's laptop as a workstation with
https://ansible.com[Ansible] installed or running a Fedora https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] 
image provided by the instructors. 

Each student's OVH public cloud instance consists of an 
https://www.rdoproject.org/[RDO Project] OpenStack `packstack` installation 
using https://www.centos.org/[CentOS] as the Linux distribution. Each instance
 will contain a file labeled  `keystonerc_demo` with all the credential 
information to use an Openstack user labeled `demo` within the project 
labeled `demo`. 

== Lab Scope

The lab exercises are intended to be small simple playbooks that effect different
areas of day-to-day OpenStack administration. Each exercise will focus on a key
element of OpenStack, i.e. network creation. Each lab
builds upon the previous lab exercise and the lab will focus on 
using as many Ansible OpenStack modules whenever possible. The final lab exercise
will encapsulate all the information you have learned from the previous labs and
provide an opportunity to test your knowledge of managing OpenStack networks, 
instances and their resources. 

== Connectivity Details

The labs require students to be able to access the OVH instance via an `ssh` 
session, via their workstation or a VirtualBox VM running Fedora. Each student
will have a specific `student_id` that is assigned by the instructor. This 
`student_id` is important as it is the name of your instance. 

*IMPORTANT: If you have not been assigned a `student_id` and
associated IP address of the instance, please get a hold
of an instructor.*

The folowing tables provide specific details about the environment that is to
be used.

| *OpenStack Dashboard | *OpenStack RC File Location* | *OpenStack User* | *Openstack Project* 
| https://<ip_of_instance>/dashboard | /root/keystonerc_demo | demo | demo

The details of the instance including the name and IP address will be 
provided by the instructor during the lab.

| *Name of Instance* | *IP Address* | *username* 
| <student_id> | <instructor_provided> | centos

The student's public SSH key i.e. `id_rsa.pub` on their workstation will be 
required in order to SSH into the instance. 

//TODO: Julio, how can we better manage this portion? Provide a private key 
//instead? Not sure of the options in OVH.
