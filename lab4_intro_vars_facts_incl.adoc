= Lab 3: Introduction to Variables, Facts, and Includes

In this lab we will continue our journey with Ansible by learning about variables, facts, and includes.

== Variables in Ansible

There are multiple ways that variables can be utilized in Ansible to store values that can be reused in order to simplify the creation and maintenance of a project while reducing errors.

Using variables provide a convenient way to manage dynamic values for a given environment in your Ansible project. Some examples of values that variables might contain include: 

* credentials (user and passwords) 
* file names
* file paths
* urls

=== Naming variables

Variables should have names which consist of a string that must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Here are a list of variables named using the right nomenclature: 

* user_name
* file_1
* file_2
* openstack_api_url
