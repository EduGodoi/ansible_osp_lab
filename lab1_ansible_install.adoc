= Lab 1: Installing prerequisites tools

=== Objective: 

The objective of this lab is to install the prerequisites needed for this session in your workstation including: 

* https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible]
* https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* Text editor

== macOS Install Intructions

=== Installing Ansible in macOS

The preferred way to install ansible on a Mac is via "pip", the Python package manager. In order to do that, launch your Terminal.

Install Pip

[source,]
----
sudo easy_install pip
----

Install Ansible with Pip

[source,]
----
sudo pip install ansible 
----

There is a second way to get Ansible installed in macOS, using https://brew.sh[Homebrew]. To do so, execute the following command: 

[source,]
----
brew install ansible
----

After this let's verify that Ansible is installed from your Terminal by executing: 

[source,]
----
ansible --version 
----

You could get an output similar to: 

----
$ ansible --version
ansible 2.0.0.2
  config file =
  configured module search path = Default w/o overridesansible --version
----

=== Installing Git in macOS

In macOS git is installed with the  Xcode Command Line Tools. First verify if git is already installed in the Operating System by launching a Terminal and typing: 

[source,]
----
git --version
----

If git is not installed a version of Git could be downloaded and installed https://git-scm.com/download/mac[Here].

=== Installing a Text editor on macOS

In this lab we will use a Sublime Text to write the ansible playbooks. To install Sublime Text download the latest version at: https://www.sublimetext.com/3 . 

== Microsoft Windows Install Instructions 

=== Installing Ansible and Git in Windows 

Ansible in Microsoft Windows could be installed using http://cygwin.com[Cygwin]. For instructions in how to install Cygwin visit the instructions in the following link: http://cygwin.com/install.html.

Here is the list of packages that need to be selected in the Cygwin installation process as dependencies: 

* curl
* python (2.7.x)
* python-jinja
* python-crypto
* python-openssl
* python-setuptools
* git (1.7.x)
* vim
* openssh
* openssl
* openssl-devel
* gcc-g++
* libffi-devel
* libmysqlclient-devel

After this install PyYAML and Jinja2 separately, as they are not available in Cygwin.

Open Cygwin and execute all the following actions:


Generate an SSH keys:

[source,]
----
ssh-keygen

Install pip:

[source,]
----
easy_install-2.7 pip
----

Install Ansible:
